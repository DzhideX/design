# Blog

The purpose of this folder is to contain all of the assets necessary for the operation of our
blog ([blog.joystream.org](https://blog.joystream.org)).

More recent blog-related assets can also be found in our communications repo.
The communications repo is updated more frequently than this folder, so if newer covers etc. are not available
here, please look for them there.
